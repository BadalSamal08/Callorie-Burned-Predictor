# Calories Prediction Using AdaBoost and XGBoost

This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during exercise based on various physiological and workout parameters. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically AdaBoost and XGBoost regressors, to build a model that provides accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

- `calories.csv`: Contains data on the number of calories burned by various users.
- `exercise.csv`: Contains data on various physiological parameters of users during exercises.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
